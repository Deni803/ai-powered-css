Post a successful transaction, the booking details will automatically reflect under the\n'Your Orders'\nsection on the app/website, once you log in via the same contact details which were used for the booking.\nThe app and website stores transaction history of the last 6 months up to 20 transactions only.\nThe provision to retrieve the past transaction history is unavailable.\nNOTE: The provision to delete 'Your Orders' manually is unavailable."
