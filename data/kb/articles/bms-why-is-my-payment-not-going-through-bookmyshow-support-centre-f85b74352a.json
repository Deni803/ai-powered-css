  "body": "Your best user experience matters to us!\nWe strongly recommend you to cross-check the details entered on the payment page, i.e. “Expiration date, CVV and OTP” are accurate.\nIf you’re trying to transact using an International card, the transaction may fail.\nHence, we suggest you to try transacting using an \"Indian bank-issued Debit card/ Credit card\" and you should be good to go.\nStill, no luck? We suggest you attempt using an alternate payment option."
