  "body": "Absolutely! You can add food and beverages while booing for a movie ticket.\nAll you need to do is, follow the usual ticket booking flow post selecting the seats and add your desired meal.\nMoreover, you can add food and beverages separately after booking the tickets via Email confirmation or 'Your Order's section, if the cinema provides an option to do so.\nNOTE\n: As per the Government regulations, no packaged food or beverages will be allowed inside the screening auditorium in certain cinemas. You may purchase & consume the same outside the auditorium.\nThe below option will not be visible on the Booking Summary page if the cinema doesn't have an option."
