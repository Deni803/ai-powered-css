  "body": "The rating on my film has dropped suddenly from 84% to 70%. Something must be wrong. Is there a fault in your system?\nIt's not uncommon for initial heart ratings for a film to be high, and then go down after it has been in theaters for a while. Films with a relatively low total number of ratings (less than a hundred) are particularly susceptible to dramatic changes in the weighted heart rating. As it has only a few ratings, it doesn't take a lot for the overall rating to change."
