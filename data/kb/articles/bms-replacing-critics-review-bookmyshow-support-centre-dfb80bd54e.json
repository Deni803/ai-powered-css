  "body": "Can you replace a Critic’s Review with low rating with a Critic’s Review with higher rating for my movie? It is affecting sales of the movie tickets.\nAs per company policy, we do not take down Critics’ Reviews from the Movie Page. Our rating formula in any case gives minimal weightage to critics’ ratings. We have found that individual reviews do not affect overall ticket sales as long as feedback from the users is favorable."
