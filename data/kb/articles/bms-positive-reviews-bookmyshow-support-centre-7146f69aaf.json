  "body": "There are only positive reviews about the film. How do I know that they are not fake or that BMS hasn't been paid to publish these?\nAll reviews, positive or negative, are approved by the system as long as they meet the guidelines mentioned above. If only positive reviews are reflecting for a movie, it is because we have only received positive user reviews for that film."
