  "body": "This is unfair! My film has received awards, great reviews, commendations and deserves a much higher heart rating. Can you change it to reflect this?\nWe didn't mean to let you down.\nOur heart ratings are largely a representation of what our users think of a film.\nWe do not delete or alter individual ratings, and we do not adjust the results of our automated weighted rating for any individual movie.\nIf the rating is lower than expected, it simply means that users have rated the film much lower than the critics who have commended it.\nHonestly, we cannot delete the rating once marked for any movie."
