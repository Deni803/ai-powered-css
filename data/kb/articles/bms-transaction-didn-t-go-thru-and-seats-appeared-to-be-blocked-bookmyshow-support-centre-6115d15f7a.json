  "body": "My previous transaction was cancelled/incomplete. Why do the\nselected\nseats appear to be booked?\nWe all have that favorite seat to watch the movie, don't we?\nIn case you've selected the seats & have proceeded to the next page, the seats are blocked to prevent another user from opting for the same seats.\nIf the booking is left incomplete/cancelled or is unsuccessful, the seats are blocked for 7 to 8 minutes which gets unblocked post the mentioned time.\n7 to 8 minutes have passed but still no luck. What now?\nIdeally, seats are auto released in 7 to 8 minutes. Chances are, someone else might have grabbed them. We urge you to go for the next best available seats or simply book for another show of your choice."
