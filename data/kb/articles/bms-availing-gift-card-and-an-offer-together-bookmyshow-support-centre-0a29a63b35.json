  "body": "Can I use a Gift card & avail an offer in one transaction?\nWe want all possible discounts in one go, don't we? Unfortunately, you'll be able to avail of either debit/credit offer or use the gift card in a transaction.\nAs for debit/credit card offer you need to make the remaining payment via the same card.\nHowever, you can club a gift card with a cashback/non-card offer and grab it.\nAll you do is apply the gift card and pay off the balance with the desired cashback/non-card offer."
