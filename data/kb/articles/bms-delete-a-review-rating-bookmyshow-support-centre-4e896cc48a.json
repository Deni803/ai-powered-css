  "body": "I know for a fact that the people who rated a particular film cannot possibly have seen it! They have a grudge against the filmmakers. Will you delete/disregard their rating/review?\nOur registered users can rate or review any film that has released in India. We are aware that there may be people who are rating for the sole purpose of trying to lower the overall rating for a film (this works both ways -- there are just as many people who try to inflate a rating). However, the overall rating calculation is overwhelmingly based in favor of people who have purchased tickets, and the final rating reflects that."
