  "body": "Cancelling a movie ticket is super easy. This video tutorial will guide you on the process.\nWe do have quite a few cinemas who now provide cancellation of confirmed tickets and it will reflect under ‘\nYour Orders\n’ on the app/website.\nIf you do not see an option to cancel the tickets under\n’ section\n, make sure you're logged in via the same Email ID/Contact number used to book the tickets.\nIf the cancellation option still does not appear, chances are that the cinema you've booked for does not provide the cancellation of confirmed tickets.\nWhilst booking the tickets, just tap on the cinema name, if you see '\nCancellation Available\n' under available facilities, you are the lucky one. Also, you may check the Email confirmation, it mentions if cancellation is available and the cut-off time. Cinemas allow cancellation of tickets between 20 minutes to 4 hours prior to showtime. (Differing from cinema to cinema).\nWhen you select the '\nCancel booking\n' tab, you get to select between 'Refund to Original Payment Mode' and ' Refund to BMS Cash'.\nRefunds to source reflect within 5 to 7 working days, whereas BMS Cash reflects within a max 2 hours in your profile.\nNote: In case you have redeemed a gift voucher while booking and canceled your tickets, the amount will be refunded to the same gift voucher. You may redeem it post 24 hours.\nNo longer, will you lose the entire amount but instead remain eligible for 75%/70%/50% of the ticket amount to be refunded depending on cancellation policy of that particular cinema.\nNOTE\n: If you have applied payback or loyalty points or have split the transaction/booking with others, the transaction is deemed ineligible for cancellation.\nPlease follow below steps to cancel your tickets:"
