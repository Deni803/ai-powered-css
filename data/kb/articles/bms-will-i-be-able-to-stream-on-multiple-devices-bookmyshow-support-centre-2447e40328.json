  "body": "Nope! You’d be able to stream the event on one device at a time. You would need to login with the same account that was used at the time of purchasing the tickets.\nSome events allow you to purchase multiple tickets for online streaming events, in that case the event can be streamed on multiple devices. The details will be visible while you are booking your tickets."
