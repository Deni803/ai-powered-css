  "body": "What is Verified by Visa?\nVerified by Visa helps you to ensure a safe and user-friendly way to transact online with a double layer of security. Once you make a payment through a visa card, you would be redirected to the 3D authentication page where you need to authenticate the transaction with a 3D Secure password or an OTP Authentication process which varies from bank to bank."
