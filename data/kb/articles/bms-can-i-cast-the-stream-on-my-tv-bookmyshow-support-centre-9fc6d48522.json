  "body": "Yes, you can! :D\nYou’d be able to cast your stream on your television using an Android Phone or Fire Stick. Your television and phone must support this feature.\nJust in case you are streaming the event on a Chrome browser, you can also use the Chromecast facility.\nIf none of the above work, you can simply connect to your television using an HDMI cord."
